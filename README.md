### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
The project was to develop a program to analyze Bikeshare data in the US  as part of Udacity Nano degree course (Data Science)

The bikeshare.py script is an interactive terminal program that ask for responses from the user then investigate one of three data files to answer  queries like the following:

    What is the most popular month for start time?
    What is the most popular day of week for start time?
    What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
    What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
    What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
    What is the most popular trip?
    What are the counts of each user type?

### Files used
The post-wrangled data files can be downloaded separately from [bikeshare-2.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k_fVtanhjwAYgcIrK07aI-uergkZzYkr/view?usp=sharing)

Data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time
    End Time
    Trip Duration (in seconds)
    Start Station
    End Station
    User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two additional columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year
